<h2><strong>Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model using AWS SageMaker</strong></h2>
<p><em>SageMaker deployment project!</em> In this project I have constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I have created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I have also deployed my model and constructed a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model</p>
<p>The result is a deployed RNN performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews complete with publicly accessible API and a simple web page which interacts with the deployed endpoint. </p>
